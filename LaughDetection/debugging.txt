I'm currently sending my audio file as a io.BufferedReader object and putting that in
the data field of the http request...is that the right way to send the request? I followed the example
on github because the multi-part file didn't work originally

I know that the request was sent properly to the server, I just don't know how to decode the bytes in the
data field on the server-side logic of things. I have gotten two different errors:
- Connection Reset by Peer error
- requests.exceptions.ChunkedEncodingError: ("Connection broken: ConnectionResetError(54, 'Connection reset by peer')", ConnectionResetError(54, 'Connection reset by peer'))

calling request.data() and request.stream() in the try clause doesn't work
- error message is Bytes object is not callable and TypeError

calling request.content_length() also gives ChunkedEncodingError "Connection broken, connection reset by peer"

if I try take out the headers part of the request, when calling request.content_type(), I will again get the ChunkedEncodingError connection reset by peer error



When I use the Postman client to send the request, I send the wav file as a binary
